/**
 This view mimics the system space button, which starts with
 displaying the `localeText`, then fading to the `spaceText`.
 
 If you don't provide a `localeText`, this view will use the
 context's current locale. If you don't provide a `spaceText`,
 it will use the localized `KKL10n.space` text.
 
 Provide empty strings if you don't want to display any text.
 
 This view creates a `SystemKeyboardSpaceButtonContent` then
 applies a keyboard button style and gestures to it.
