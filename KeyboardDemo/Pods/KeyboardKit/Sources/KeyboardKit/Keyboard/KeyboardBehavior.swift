 This protocol can be used to specify behavior rules for the
 keyboard. It aims to separate behavior from action handling
 to make the code cleaner and more understandable.
 
 `KeyboardKit` will automatically create a standard instance
 and bind it to the input view controller when the extension
 is started. You can use it and replace it with a custom one.
